# Pokedex-CLI
A Command Line written in Golang, is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

## Usage
1. Use `help` command to know about all the commands existing in the system.
2. Intially you can use `map` command to go through the locations,
3. For any location you can use the `expore <location_name>` to see all the pokemons available in that location.
4. In order to catch that pokemon use `catch <pokemon_name>`.
5. Finally you can see all the pokemons you caught using inspect command.
